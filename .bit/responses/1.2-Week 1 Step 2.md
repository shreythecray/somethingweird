## Week 1 Step 2

### What are APIs?

### APIs are cool!

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) essentially allow computers to communicate.m An API is referred to as a **software intermediary** and it provides a channel for various applications to "talk" to each other, without needed direct access to each other's code/implementation.

You could compare APIs to telephones in the real world, where two people (applications) can provide **messages** **to** and get **responses** **from** each other without being in the same room.

### What APIs are we using?

- Twitter API: interact with tweets
- Azure Text API: sentiment/emotion analysis on text
- Azure Face API: sentiment/emotion analysis on images of human faces
- Twilio SMS API: automate sending text messages

### Review:

**Add to your notes.md file:** think about about an API (or multiple) that you have seen before and what this API was used for. If you haven't come across any, feel free to research and find one that interests you. Create a flow chart that explains how this API works and add this to your notes.md file.
