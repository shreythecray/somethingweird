## Week 1 Step 3

### Let's Get Started

### Packages

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager) is an **open source developer tool ðŸ”¨** that allows developers to build JavaScript publicly available code, also known as, **packages**. We will be using npm to get access to:

- Lowdb: package for small databases ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lowdb))
- Twit: Twitter API client for node ([documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twit))
- Twilio

**[Read More about packages â€”>](https://cleverbeagle.com/blog/articles/what-are-javascript-packages-and-dependencies)**

**[Read More about npm â€”>](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/)**

Don't have node installed? **[Read more about how you can install Node.js and npm.](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)**

Before starting, we want to download a few packages required for this app. Open your terminal in VS Code and run the following commands in order.

If you run across any errors, feel free to troubleshoot on Google.

```
npm install twilio
npm install twit
npm install lowdb
```

### Start Coding

**[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)** this current repository by copying the link to the repo and running the following code:

```
git init

git clone [link to repo]
```

In your local repo (the one that you just made), create a file within the folder called `app.js` add the following to your `app.js` file 

```
const low = require('lowdb')
const FileSync = require('lowdb/adapters/FileSync')

const adapter = new FileSync('db.json')
const db = low(adapter)
```

Now we need to get access to the Twit package by adding the following line of code:

```
var Twit = require('twit')
```

### Review:

**Add to your notes.md file:** describe what your app.js file can do at this moment and make a PR with your updated notes.md file.
